Step 1. Begin the game.
Step 2. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 10.
Step 3. If the player still has guesses left the computer will ask the player to guess the number.
Step 4. The computer will check if the player's guess is correct.
Step 5. If the player's guess is correct the computer will congratulate the player and finish the game. If the player's guess is incorrect the computer will tell the player the guess is wrong and will tell them how many guesses are left and will reduce the number of guesses by 1.
Step 6. If the player runs out of guesses, the computer will tell the player they have no more guesses and reveal the correct number, before ending the game.
